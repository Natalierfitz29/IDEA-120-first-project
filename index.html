<p><i>How to Deal</i><br>
Soreness Is Actually<br>
Yes, I'd been sore the day before too,<br>
but this was on another level<br>
</p>
<p> 48 to 72 hours after,<br>
as your body really goes to work on the process<br>
super light, since you don't want more damage<br>
</p>
<p>Why Is My Body Sore?<br>
Waking up feeling super sore <br>
and not knowing why<br>
These are definitely both things<br>
I have needlessly worried about<br>
the headache, the nausea, and all the things<br>

How Sore Should You Be<br>
adage “no pain, no gain,”<br>
but how much truth is there to that mantra?<br>
Check in with your body<br>
Yes, there was once a cigarette diet<br>
and other odd diets of the not-so-distant past.<br>
